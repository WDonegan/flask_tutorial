<h1>My Flask Tutorial Repository</h1>

<h3>GOAL: To learn the basics of flask; I want build a 
site to use as my portfolio/resume and blog.
</h3>

<h3>Currently my website (<a>www.donegan.dev</a>) is just a 
Google site, drag and drop interface, with no blog support 
that I know of.</h3>

This package was referred to me while I was attending at 
PyCon2022 in Salt Lake City, UT. I was in the first steps of
a Django tutorial, when I was shown a resume site done in 
flask. 

It appeared very similar to the Django tutorial, and 
it was explained to me that Flask is sort of a lighter weight
version of Django, more for smaller apps. This makes for a 
good starting point, before getting deeper into Django.
